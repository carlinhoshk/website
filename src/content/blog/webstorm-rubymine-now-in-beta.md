Today, we continue to expand support for JetBrains IDEs with Gitpod as part of our [official partnership](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains) and general ðŸ’• love and admiration for [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). At Gitpod we have a [value](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-core-values) _Integrate, don't dictate_ which means we believe in the power of _your_ choice. [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) users rejoice! You may now choose to use WebStorm and RubyMine with Gitpod ðŸŽ‰.

Here's a screencast to see exactly how working with JetBrains IDE and Gitpod looks.

## Getting Started

Here's how you can get started with a JetBrains IDE in Gitpod today:

1. **Install [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html#gateway)** - With the [JetBrains Gateway and Gitpod](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) plugin you can create and manage your latest 20 Gitpod workspaces.
2. **Install the Gitpod plugin** - Open JetBrains Gateway and you'll see the Gitpod logo on the main page. Click "install" to install the [Gitpod plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) for JetBrains Gateway.
3. **Update your Gitpod preferences** - Select RubyMine or WebStorm on the [Gitpod preferences page](https://gitpod.io/preferences) which will set RubyMine or WebStorm as your default IDE for future workspace starts.
4. **Start (or restart) your workspace** - Either start a workspace directly from within the [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) via the Gitpod plugin **OR** open a new workspace directly in Gitpod where on workspace start you will be prompted to open RubyMine or WebStorm for that workspace.
