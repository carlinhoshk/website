This June 1 and 2, we welcomed 60 people to our first ever in-person conference, CDE Universe in San Francisco.

Engineers from Uber, Slack, Shopify, and more each shared the challenges and benefits of building their own Cloud Development Environments for their teams.

For some companies, the internal CDE platform was primarily about unlocking developer productivity. For others, CDEs offered a chance to unblock teams as codebases scaled beyond what was manageable on a single developer laptop. Each shared the challenges and successes in deploying CDEs to their development teams.

## Uber: Devpod

[Matas Strukƒçinskas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matas-strukcinskas/) from Uber shared how they built a platform deployed to multiple regions, to minimize development latency for Uber‚Äôs global development teams.

Devpod is Uber‚Äôs platform for developers, and it‚Äôs a long-lived development environment with different ‚Äúflavors‚Äù. Each subteam can use the language that fits best for them, and get up and running quickly.

An engineer shared, ‚Äú_I gave up trying to use a macbook for development. Just stick with devpod. That thing is awesome!_‚Äù With reduced onboarding time and faster build times, Devpod is becoming the default development environment for engineers at Uber.

## Slack: remote development with CDEs

Similar to Uber, Slack reported that 85% of their engineers use cloud development environments.

Slack engineers benefitted from the five minute onboarding time, low context switching as isolated environments were ready for every feature or project, low maintenance due to the lack of local dependencies to maintain and were easier to scale with a single configuration change.

The choices increase as CDEs become more popular. The future of CDEs at Slack is either to build or buy but whichever choice, CDEs are here to stay.

## Shopify: Isospin

Shopify's [Olga Pilipenco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olgapilipenco) shared how their org has been asking a single question over and over on the DevAccel team:

She shared how Shopify has iterated on their in-house CDE, focusing first on the developer experience, to ensure that Shopify developers are able to build, test, and ship features to products in a rapidly growing ecosystem.

As Matas put at the end of his talk, _‚ÄúEngineering is not only about making things work; it's about making things better._‚Äù With improved developer efficiency, faster onboarding, automation, better collaboration and improved security, CDEs make things better. We‚Äôre excited to have shown a glimpse of what the future of software engineering looks like!
