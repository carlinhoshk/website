[Cloud Development Environments](/cde) (CDEs) bring the creative workflow of writing software to the cloud. CDEs make software development more collaborative and powerful. Driven by the benefits of automation and the scale of the cloud, CDEs will bring about a huge leap in developer productivity.

Gitpod is hosting [CDE Universe](https://cdeuniverse.com/) - a 2-day single track conference with 100 participants in San Francisco on June 1-2, 2023. We are bringing together the visionaries, builders, and practitioners that make up the CDE Universe to network, learn, and discuss solutions.

This is the 3rd annual conference Gitpod is hosting for the ecosystem. After two virtual editions of [DevX Conf](https://devxconf.org/), focused on developer experience at large, we want to use the more intimate setting of an in-person conference for a focused topic: cloud development.

Developers are shaping what the future looks like when it comes to building the next generation of tooling. CDE Universe is a place to choose and discuss what the future should be.

Engineering teams large and small are moving beyond local development in search of a more collaborative and seamless developer experience. Platform engineering and DevX teams are tasked with choosing the right software and systems that enable developer self-serve. Gitpod is hosting an in-person event for these practitioners to discuss how we can increase the velocity, autonomy, productivity and security of our development practices.

Directionally, the speakers at CDE Universe come from these groups: (1) internal platform teams at leading software companies who have built their own CDE solutions, (2) developer tools that make up the CDE Universe.

## Attend

CDE Universe is a single track conference over two days. It will be hosted as in-person on June 1st and 2nd in San Francisco, CA. The conference space is limited. In this initial edition, we will have 100 attendees in order to keep this an intimate event that gives the CDE community a chance to have more personal interactions. Head to the [conference website](https://cdeuniverse.com/) to learn more and buy your ticket.

## Call for Proposals

Our CFP is live and hosted on [papercall.io](https://www.papercall.io/cde-universe).

<p class='underline underline-offset-1'>If your company made the transition to cloud development environments, we want to hear your story.</p>

Join the stage at CDE Universe with companies like Uber, Slack, and Stripe who have all created CDE solutions, in search of higher developer productivity.

CDEs allow us to rethink the tools we use to develop software. Topics we’re interested in include:

    - Cloud Development - Secrets management - Ephemeral Databases - Development Infrastructure as Code - Collaboration

    - Deployment - CI/CD Systems for Development - Reproducible builds - Dependencies Management - Testing in Production

    - Development Tooling - Next-gen IDEs, Code Companions, Development containers

This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a peak at what is possible. For example, if you have a contribution around using LLMs in CDEs, we are interested in hearing it as well.

We are looking for 25 minute talks, with 5 minutes for Q&A.

## Partnerships

Are you interested in supporting the CDE Universe and get partnership access? You can find our prospectus [here](https://cdeuniverse.com/docs/partners-program-CDEuniverse.pdf). Let's partner up!

## Thank You

We appreciate our community and look forward to working with you to build a better developer experience for all of us.
