## Even more power! &#x26A1; Try large workspaces with pay-as-you-go &#x1F389;

> **Important:** Prices and terms are subject to change.

With [pay-as-you-go](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/billing/pay-as-you-go) you get early access to [workspace classes](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes), allowing you to customize your workspace resources. To get access to [pay-as-you-go](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/billing/pay-as-you-go) either for teams or individual users, please [contact us](https://www.gitpod.io/contact/support).

**How does pay-as-you-go work?**

-   Gitpod usage is measured in credits, based on how long your workspaces run, and the resources consumed by different workspace classes. Metered usage also includes [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds).
-   [Individual users](/docs/configure/billing/pay-as-you-go#configure-personal-billing) receive 500 free credits per month on the free plan, these credits are equivalent to 50 Standard workspace hours or 25 Large workspace hours.
-   For users who upgrade to the personal paid plan at ‚Ç¨/$ 9.00 per month, workspace usage allowance increases to 1000 credits.
-   The standard pay-as-you-go rate for paid users, and [for teams](/docs/configure/billing/pay-as-you-go#configure-team-billing), is ‚Ç¨/$ 0.036 per credit.
-   Existing paid plans need to be cancelled for pay-as-you-go billing to work.

## Start workspaces based on existing prebuilds ‚ö°Ô∏è

![Prebuild Detail page - Start new (workspace with this prebuild) button](/images/changelog/2022-10-31/start-new-workspace-with-this-prebuild.jpg)
_Start a new workspace based on an existing prebuild_

You can now start workspaces using existing prebuilds. This helps when you have a repo with many commits, so you're not left waiting for the latest prebuild to finish. To get started, select a prebuild from your project prebuild list, and click "**New Workspace (with this prebuild)**"

## JetBrains RubyMine and WebStorm IDEs now in beta &#x1F680;

![JetBrains RubyMine and WebStorm logos connected to a Gitpod logo](/images/blog/webstorm-rubymine-now-in-beta/webstorm-rubymine-announcement-gitpod.webp)

We are continuing to expand support for JetBrains IDEs as part of our [official partnership](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains) with [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).

See the [RubyMine & WebStorm announcement](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/webstorm-rubymine-now-in-beta) for more.

## New "exposed ports" view in VS Code Desktop &#x1F50C;

![A panel in VS Code Desktop listing open ports in the workspace](/images/editors/vscode-exposed-ports.png)

To give you all the power of Gitpod, we've added a new tab, <kbd>EXPOSED PORTS</kbd>, which gives you additional functionality in addition to the regular ports view of _Remote - SSH_, like port visibility (public/private).

> **Note:** Due to constraints with [Remote - SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh), we cannot extend the default VS Code ports view.

## Ports sorting now based on your gitpod.yml definition &#x23EC;

Ports shown in all Gitpod clients are now ordered based on:

1. The order of the ports definition in the `.gitpod.yml`
2. All other ports are numerically sorted in ascending order.

This change applies to all of VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, SSH and the Gitpod CLI.

Example output of `gp ports list`:

```sh
| PORT  | STATUS         | URL                            | NAME & DESCRIPTION |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 3000  | open (public)  | https://3000-repo...gitpod.io  | Web Server Preview |
| 5900  | open (private) | https://5900-repo...gitpod.io  | Postgres Database  |
| 5555  | open (private) | https://5555-repo...gitpod.io  |                    |
| 36341 | open (private) | https://36341-repo...gitpod.io |                    |
```

See [ports](/docs/configure/workspaces/ports) documentation for more.

<!-- https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/13788 -->

## Easily find information about your workspace with `gp info` ‚ÑπÔ∏è

You can now display information about the current [workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces) (such as the workspace ID and URL) and also the [workspace class](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes), using the new command from [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) called `gp info`.

**Example output:**

```sh
  Workspace ID    : gitpodio-gitpod-4q1200dvfcf
  Instance ID     : 8a6188a3-4c7f-49fe-aa4d-db968c11e183
  Workspace class : Large: Up to 8 vCPU, 16GB memory, 50GB disk
  Workspace URL   : https://gitpodio-gitpod-4q1200dvfcf.ws-eu67.gitpod.io
  Cluster host    : ws-eu67.gitpod.io
```

See the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#info) reference page for more.

> [Default environment variables](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables#default-environment-variables) will soon be deprecated, please update all scripts to use `gp info --json`.

## VS Code ports view is now responsive &#x23E9;

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Responsive ports view in VS Code" src="/images/changelog/2022-10-31/responsive-ports.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption><i>New ports view on left navigation, with responsive design</i></figcaption>
</figure>

The ports view in VS Code is now responsive depending on the ports view width. The view defaults to the bottom VS Code navigation bar, however, the ports view can be drag-and-dropped to the sidebar if you prefer. You can access all port actions as normal on all views. In larger views, more information about your ports is shown.

<!-- TODO: Should this wording not be visibilty? -->

For feedback let us know on the [ports experience GitHub issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/9262).

## Projects now only created under teams, not personal accounts ‚ö†Ô∏è

-   You can no longer create Gitpod Projects under personal accounts.
-   All projects must now be created as part of a team.
-   Existing personal projects will continue to work.

## Using private workspace images is now in alpha

Did you know that you can [use a private Docker image](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#use-a-private-docker-image) with Gitpod? Private Docker image support for workspace images has been possible for some time, however it was an undocumented feature. We've now updated our documentation so that you can more easily give try out the feature. As the feature is currently alpha, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/new/choose) for any feedback.
