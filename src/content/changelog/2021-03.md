Aligned with our [Next Chapter for Gitpod](/blog/next-chapter-for-gitpod) announcement, we reimplemented and redesigned the Gitpod dashboard!

Technical improvements under the hood result in a more performant, snappier dashboard. We would love to hear your feedback and learn how we can provide you with an even better experience. Please provide your comments in our [feedback issue #3727](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/3727) 🙏🏻.
