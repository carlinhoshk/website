We’ve enabled the ability to select the organization, editor, and workspace class used when opening a workspace. Giving you the ability to:

-   Select which organization will be billed.
-   Change editor and scale resources per workspace.
-   Be certain about how many credits per hour will be consumed.

We look forward to hearing your feedback! [github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/17215](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/17215)
