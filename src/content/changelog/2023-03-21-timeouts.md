You can now set your workspace timeout up to 24 hours using the command line, direct in your favorite editor or IDE or configure a global default! Setting a configurable timeout is useful if you're working on a long running task, need to leave your workspace open for a while and then revisit it, or whilst collaborating or sharing previews with others.

To try out this feature, type: `gp timeout set 1h` to set the timeout for the currently running workspace to 1 hour. Or, go to your [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/user/preferences) to set the default value for all future timeouts.
