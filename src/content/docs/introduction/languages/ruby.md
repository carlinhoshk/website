# Ruby in Gitpod

It's relatively easy to set up your Ruby project in Gitpod.

## Ruby Versions

As of this writing, Gitpod comes with Ruby 3.1 pre-installed in the [gitpod/workspace-full](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-full).

To use a different Ruby version, you can [change the base image](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#configure-a-public-docker-image) to one of the following:

-   [gitpod/workspace-ruby-2](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-ruby-2)
-   [gitpod/workspace-ruby-3.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-ruby-3.0)

These images are automatically updated every week with the latest ruby patch versions.

To use a fixed version, you may use a [custom Dockerfile](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#configure-a-custom-dockerfile).

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full
USER gitpod

# Install Ruby version 2.7.6 and set it as default
RUN _ruby_version=ruby-2.7.6 \
    && printf "rvm_gems_path=/home/gitpod/.rvm\n" > ~/.rvmrc \
    && bash -lc "rvm reinstall ${_ruby_version} && \
                 rvm use ${_ruby_version} --default" \
    && printf "rvm_gems_path=/workspace/.rvm" > ~/.rvmrc \
    && printf "{ rvm use \$(rvm current); } >/dev/null 2>&1\n" >> "$HOME/.bashrc.d/70-ruby"
```

> ðŸ’¡ Explanation: Gitpod initially [sets up RVM](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/481f7600b725e0ab507fbf8377641a562a475625/chunks/lang-ruby/Dockerfile#L11-L26) in `/home/gitpod/.rvm`, but then later switches the RVM configuration directory to `/workspace/.rvm`, so that any user-made changes (like installing new gems) are persisted within a Gitpod workspace. However, during the Dockerfile build, the `/workspace` directory doesn't exist yet, so we temporarily reset RVM's configuration directory to `/home/gitpod/.rvm`.

## Example Repositories

Here are a few Ruby example projects that are already automated with Gitpod:

## VS Code Extensions

Here are a few useful extensions that you'll likely want to install in your Ruby project.

### [Ruby Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connorshea.vscode-ruby-test-adapter)

With the Ruby test explorer, you can run unit tests from within the Gitpod UI.
![Ruby test explorer example](/images/docs/ruby_test_ui.png)
To add this extension to your repository, simply add these lines to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) configuration file:

```yml
vscode:
    extensions:
        - connorshea.vscode-ruby-test-adapter@0.9.0
        - hbenl.vscode-test-explorer@2.21.1
```

## Ruby On Rails

So, you want to write your cool new Ruby On Rails application in Gitpod? Well, here is an idea of how to do it. Please take a look at our [minimal Rails example](https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-Ruby-On-Rails) running in Gitpod:

## FAQs

### [How to avoid the need to run "bundle install" each time I restart my workspace?](https://discord.com/channels/816244985187008514/1082108211936645182)

To avoid running `bundle install` each time you restart your workspace in Gitpod, try changing your `.gitpod.yml` file configuration. Instead of using `init`, use a `before` task, as it will be re-run each time the workspace is restarted.

Here's an example:

```yml
tasks:
    - before: bundle install
```

For more information on tasks, refer to the Gitpod [docs on tasks](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks).

**Note**: When a workspace is deactivated, only the workspace directory is saved and restored. Therefore, if `bundle install` creates files in various places in the file system, they may not be retained after a restart.
