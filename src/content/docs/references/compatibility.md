# Compatibility

> ⚠️ **Gitpod Self-hosted is [no longer supported](/blog/introducing-gitpod-dedicated)**
>
> The last update of Gitpod Self-hosted product was [November 2022](/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). Users can still request our [free community license](/community-license) however there will be no support or updates to the product. If you are interested in an isolated, private installation of Gitpod, take a look at [Gitpod Dedicated](/dedicated).

This page shows you what components and services Gitpod is and is not compatible with. It is aimed at both individual developers that use Gitpod as well as admins that install and maintain a [Gitpod Self-Hosted](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest) instance. You can filter the table to show only what is relevant to you.

> **Note:** It is required to have at least one of each category. SaaS users can ignore the self-hosted specific categories (see filter)
