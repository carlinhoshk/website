# Public roadmap

> ðŸš§ **Under Construction** ðŸš§ - Looking for the Gitpod public roadmap?

We are currently in a process of re-thinking how we can best communicate upcoming changes to Gitpod with our customers, users and community members.

We still _love_ hearing what you think about Gitpod, as we build the future of [CDE](https://www.gitpod.io/cde)'s togetherâ€”that has not changed! In the mean time, here are some ways that you can stay in touch:

-   To see what was recently released, see our [Changelog](https://gitpod.io/changelog).
-   For feedback and feature requests, see our repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/new/choose).
-   To chat about Gitpod, join us in [Discord](https://gitpod.io/chat).

**Why did we deprecate the public roadmap?**

Our previous public roadmap was tied to GitHub issues, which became difficult to maintain and could at times be confusing or misleading, especially when plans changedâ€”as they often doâ€”as we adapted Gitpod features to the feedback of our users and customers.

**Where can I hear about what's planned and upcoming?**

Keep an eye on our [Changelog](https://gitpod.io/changelog), because we like to [rollout features early](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) to get your feedback and input. We're also very active in [Discord](https://gitpod.io/chat), which is a great place for discussions and conversations about Gitpod... so, why not join the next community session?
