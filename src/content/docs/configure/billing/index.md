# Billing

Gitpod usage is measured in credits. Credits are consumed per organization for the usage of all organization members. Your invoice will show the total amount of credits consumed in a billing period. A billing period is 1 month and starts on the day your subscription is activated. Credits are consumed for every hour that a workspace is running. The number of credits that are consumed also depends on the [Workspace Class](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes#workspace-classes). [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) also consume credits.

**For example:**

-   **Standard**: up to 4 cores, up to 8GB RAM, 30GB storage, 10 credits per hour.
-   **Large**: up to 8 cores, up to 16GB RAM, 50GB storage, 20 credits per hour.

## Tiers

## Billing

### View Billing

To view billing information for an organization:

1. First, ensure that you are looking at the correct Organization. Your Organization is shown, and can be changed in the top-left corner of the Gitpod dashboard.
2. To view billing data, you must be assigned the [organization owner](/docs/configure/orgs/members) role. Only existing owners of an organisation can assign the owner role to other users.
3. To see your billing preferences, navigate to the organization menu (top left corner) in the Gitpod dashboard and select "Billing".

### Update Billing

Organization owners can subscribe to a new billing plan via the billing page by clicking on "Upgrade Plan".

## Usage

### Configure a Usage Limit

To avoid unexpected costs, you can set a custom usage limit that is applied to the Organization. Once the usage limit is reached, new workspaces will no longer start, however currently running workspaces will not be automatically stopped.

To adjust the usage limit for an Organization navigate to the "Update limit" option within the balance section of your organization billing preferences. The usage limit option is not available until the billing subscription is enabled for the Organization.

## FAQs

### [How can I limit or optimize prebuild costs?](https://discord.com/channels/816244985187008514/1070648758716600371)

<!-- DISCORD_BOT_FAQ - DO NOT REMOVE -->

There are a few built-in Gitpod features that can optimize your prebuild costs, such as:

-   **Skip prebuilds** every X commits and use [last successful prebuild](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/projects/last-successful-prebuild)

-   **Stop prebuilds** for all branches, PRs and etc. when on GitHub. See [this page](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-yml/#github). (might not be necessary)

### With prebuilds enabled, does every push to my repository cost me credits?

It depends on how you configured prebuilds. Prebuilds run on headless Gitpod workspaces and the cost depends on how long they run when triggered.

### I was charged twice, can you help?

Certainly, please send us a message at billing@gitpod.io
