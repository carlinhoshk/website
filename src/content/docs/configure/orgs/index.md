# Organizations

An organization can be used to represent a group of people collaborating together with Gitpod, such as an entire company or an open source collective. Through Gitpod organizations you can:

-   [Manage Organization Members](/docs/configure/orgs/members)
-   [Manage Projects](/docs/configure/projects) (and [Prebuild](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) configurations)
-   [Apply Organization Policies](/docs/configure/orgs/policies) (e.g. restrict workspace sharing)
