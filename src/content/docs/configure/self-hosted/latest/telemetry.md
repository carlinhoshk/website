We optionally collect telemetry from Gitpod Self-Hosted installations to better understand the needs and use cases of the Gitpod community. Collected telemetry contains simple usage statistics like the number of users and workspaces. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.gitpod.io/privacy) describes in detail how we use this data.

To provide individualized support to enterprise customers we optionally collect a customer ID. This customer ID provides insights into enterprise adoption of Gitpod and helps us ensure that customers get the best value from their installations. Self-hosted installations using the community license do not have a customer ID and will be anonymous.

## Controlling your telemetry

You can preview your usage telemetry, control how much information you share, and enable/disable all usage telemetry on `Settings` tab on the `Admin` dashboard. To anonymize your usage telemetry, uncheck the **Include customer ID in telemetry** option. To fully disable telemetry, uncheck the **Enable usage telemetry** option.

A preview of your usage telemetry is available on the settings page to provide transparency about the data we'd like to collect.
