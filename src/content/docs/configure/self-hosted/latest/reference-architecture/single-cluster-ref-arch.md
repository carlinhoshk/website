# Single-Cluster Reference Architecture for Production Purposes

> ⚠️ **Gitpod Self-hosted is [no longer supported](/blog/introducing-gitpod-dedicated)**
>
> The last update of Gitpod Self-hosted product was [November 2022](/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). Users can still request our [free community license](/community-license) however there will be no support or updates to the product. If you are interested in an isolated, private installation of Gitpod, take a look at [Gitpod Dedicated](/dedicated).

This guide describes a single-cluster reference architecture for Gitpod aimed at production environments: continuous deployments of Gitpod used in anger by your engineers. It consists of a Kubernetes cluster, cert-manager, external MySQL database, external OCI image registry, and external object storage. It includes instructions on how to set up this reference architecture on the officially supported cloud providers.

This reference architecture can be used as a blueprint for your Gitpod installation: Start with this reference architecture and adapt it to your needs. The reference architecture as described in this guide is what Gitpod supports, and is used to test against every self-hosted Gitpod release.

To use Gitpod, you also need a Git source code management system (SCM) like GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket. You will find the supported SCMs in the [product compatibility matrix](/docs/references/compatibility?admin) your own SCM is beyond the scope of this guide. However, you can simply use the cloud versions of GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket as well as the possible existing installation in your corporate network.
