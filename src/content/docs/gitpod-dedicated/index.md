# Gitpod Dedicated docs

Gitpod provides on-demand, secure cloud development environments or [CDEs](/cde). These environments include everything a developer needs, including tools, code, and dependencies, _and_ can seamlessly be shared and cloned across the team.

There are two ways to consume the product: Via Gitpod Cloud, available via [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) and via Gitpod Dedicated that is cloud development environment that is hosted by you and managed by Gitpod. **This documentation walks through Gitpod Dedicated.**

In both deployments models, a control plane keeps the installation up-to-date. The system polls for updates every minute. Once a new one is available, it pulls the package down. The system is built so that no downtime is needed for updates, and workspaces are never affected.

## Gitpod Cloud vs. Gitpod Dedicated

Gitpod Cloud is a multi-tenanted solution that provides isolation and security by operating developer workspaces in their own set of Linux namespaces, such that they cannot interfere with others. The details of this setup have been shared publicly. Gitpod Cloud is best for teams who are ready to get started right away and prefer no installation.

![Gitpod Cloud Overview](/images/docs/gitpod-dedicated/gitpod-cloud-overview.webp)

Gitpod Dedicated is a single-tenant solution also maintained and operated by Gitpod. The entire application is deployed within a customer's cloud account, acting like an outpost of Gitpod within their cloud organization, very similar to the way a self-hosted solution would behave. The Gitpod Dedicated Control Plane is only responsible for monitoring the status of the instance and managing updates:

Running Gitpod Dedicated within the customer’s infrastructure ensures that Gitpod does not have direct access to source code, running workspaces or other confidential resources. This satisfies many regulatory and compliance-related policies around data residency and access.

Gitpod Dedicated is best for organizations who have more stringent security requirements.

## Overview of Setup Process

Gitpod Dedicated is deployed into the customer AWS account using a CloudFormation template. The actual deployment process itself takes around 30 minutes. To begin, create a new AWS account within the customer’s AWS organization. Then, execute a CloudFormation template that creates the necessary infrastructure. After that, the instance will register itself with the Dedicated Control plane and installs the latest version of Gitpod.

Once deployed, the instance is able to connect to a source control management system (SCM) and other development resources on a corporate network *privately (*using a Transit Gateway attachment).

To start the first Gitpod workspace, navigate to the instance and configure an integration to an SCM system. Gitpod will then manage and operate the instance. For more information on how updates are handled, please see the [Deployment and Updates](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/background/deployment-updates) section.

## Getting started

To begin, follow the [Getting Started](/docs/gitpod-dedicated/guides/getting-started) guide.
