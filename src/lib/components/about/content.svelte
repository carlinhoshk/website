			Make software engineering collaborative and joyful again.
		</h2>

		<p class="text-large">
			Developers write software within languages/frameworks, build tools,
			glue them together to (tool) chains, develop against APIs and
			communicate and collaborate with our colleagues. All of that should
			be efficient, joyful and secure.
		</p>
		<p class="text-large">
			Yet it is not. Devs constantly struggle with larger codebases,
			cluttered dependencies, security policies and unnecessary friction
			in their workflows.
		</p>
		<p class="text-large">
			We want to make developers feel again that everything is at their
			fingertips.
		</p>

		<h2 class="h3">
			Gitpod was founded because we were frustrated by manually setting up
			and maintaining dev environments.
		</h2>

		<p class="text-large">
			We are building Gitpod in the open to easily spin-up fresh dev
			environments for any task. Those ephemeral environments are fast &
			powerful, fully automated & initialized. They empower developers to
			immediately start coding, debugging, and testing their code.
		</p>

		<p class="text-large">Only then developers are always ready-to-code.</p>

		<h2 class="h3">Built on shared principles</h2>

		<p class="text-large">
			Values are important to us. We are developer-led and aim for a
			frictionless experience when interacting with our product, our
			company and our brand: no hurdles, no BS, no unnecessary extra
			steps.
		</p>

		<p class="text-large">
			We believe in the benefits of an open culture. We are open minded,
			inclusive, transparent and curious. We always remain students of the
			game, not masters of the game. We have opinions, but are not
			opinionated. We integrate, don't dictate.
		</p>

		<h2 class="h3">Backed by great investors</h2>

		<p class="text-large">
			Founded in 2020, Gitpod Inc. raised over $35m to date from some of
			the world’s most renowned open source investors. Our early backers
			include General Catalyst as well as Speedinvest, Crane and Vertex.
