## Status

2022-10-18 accepted

## Context

While, website performance audit report [#1466](https://github.com/gitpod-io/website/issues/1466) & Lighthouse report analysis, that website should have all image assets with `.webp` extension and all video assets with `.webm`. It is also a recommendation from [web.dev](https://web.dev/efficient-animated-content/#why-you-should-replace-animated-gifs-with-video).

## Decision

We have decided to use convert & use all the assets in following manner:

| Type of file | Old file format | New file format |
| :----------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
|    Video     |     `.gif`      |     `.webm`     |
|    Video     |     `.mp4`      |     `.webm`     |
|    Image     |     `.png`      |     `.webp`     |
|    Image     |     `.jpg`      |     `.webp`     |
|    Image     |     `.jpeg`     |     `.webp`     |

> To Convert all the old assets to the new, Progress is meausred on these PRs [[1](https://github.com/gitpod-io/website/pull/2923)], [[2](https://github.com/gitpod-io/website/pull/2921)].

## Consequences

-   Higher Picture Quality with smaller size leads to higher performance & faster loading time.
-   Relatively Faster build time.
